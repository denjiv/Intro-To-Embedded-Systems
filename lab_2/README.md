This lab builds on the knowledge of exporting and configuring pins from the previous lab. A LCD driver was developed utilizing named pipes. Moreover, a Hangman game was developed and the LCD was used to interface with it. Finally, a short program was developed to toggle a GPIO low-high-low in order to observe the scheduler jitter of the operating system in BeagleBone.
