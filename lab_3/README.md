This lab focuses on the implementation of an LCD kernel mode driver while using a shift register for data transfer in order cut down the number of GPIO usage. We also incorporated the Leap Motion Controller to send hand gesture signals to the BeagleBone through bluetooth, thereby controlling the LCD and the motors through an H-Bridge.
